- User-friendly GUI interface
- Separate sections for Cosmetics, Grocery, and Cold Drinks
- Automatic calculation of total prices and applicable taxes
- Bill generation with customer details and item breakdown
- Fields for entering customer name and phone number
- Buttons for total calculation, bill generation, print, email, and clear (some features are placeholders)

## 📐 Key Functions

### `total()`
- Calculates category-wise totals:
  ```python
  total_cosmetic = sum(qty * price for each cosmetic item)
  total_grocery = sum(qty * price for each grocery item)
  total_colddrinks = sum(qty * price for each colddrink item)
````

* Computes respective taxes using defined rates.
* Updates UI fields with totals and tax amounts.

### `generate_bill()`

* Validates customer name and phone number
* Displays selected items with quantities and total prices in the bill area
* Outputs structured bill text format

---

## 📌 Technologies Used

* Python 🐍
* Tkinter (GUI)

---

## 📂 Files

* `retail_bill_management.py` – GUI interface and frame layout
* `calculations.py` – Logic for total, bill generation, and validation

---

## 🧑‍💻 Future Enhancements

* Implement `send_email()` and `print_bill()` features
* Add persistent storage (e.g., SQLite) for customer history
* Add invoice PDF export
